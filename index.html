                        It is expected that Bangladesh will not only save such amount of money in the future, but also would earn a lot by letting other countries to lease the unused bandwidth. The launch of satellite Bangabandhu-1 by Bangladesh brings both prospects and challenges as it is expected to help the country save Foreign currency, while the challenges remain in effectively running the venture.
